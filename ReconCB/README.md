# ReconCB
Take a domain name and seek out subdomain names, probe for live hosts, retrieve WayBackURL data, gather screenshots and more. I try to keep this script 
up to date in conjunction with `kaliQuick.sh` so that all prerequisite dependencies are met before running it.

## Usage

```
./reconCB -d <domain>
```

## Prerequisites
* Amass
* Subfinder
* SubDomainizer
* getallurls (gau) 
* Httprobe
* GoSpider
* Eyewitness
